# Minesweeper-Game
This is a classic Minesweeper game implemented using [your tech stack]. The objective is to uncover all non-mine cells on the grid using logical clues provided by the numbers, without triggering any hidden mines. The game features multiple difficulty levels, a flagging system to mark suspected mines, a timer, and an intuitive user interface. It ensures a safe first click and includes proper win/lose detection. This project demonstrates fundamental game logic, UI handling, and interactive gameplay, making it a fun and educational coding exercise.
